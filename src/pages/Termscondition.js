        <h5>1. Services</h5>

          We are very pleased that you (“Client” or “you” as the context requires) have engaged Virtual Reality Creators Corp., a NJ corporation, d/b/a Animation Rush (“Animation Rush”, “Company,” “us,” or “we,” as the context requires) to perform the services as set forth in a statement of work (or quote, as the case may be), and any subsequent written statement of work, which may be electronically accepted (each a “SOW” (also may be referred to as a “Quote”) and the work thereunder, the “Services”). This letter (the “Agreement”) is effective as of the last date of signature below (the “Effective Date”). There are no products sold or provided under this Agreement. Client understands and agrees that each Quote will be governed by this Agreement.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Orders, Term</h5>
        <p>
          Client shall purchase Services by delivering to Company a signed SOW (a sample form of SOW is attached hereto as Exhibit A). The term of each SOW shall be stated in the SOW. Each SOW hereunder shall terminate immediately upon termination of the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by Company. If, after completion of the Services, we continue to perform services at your written request, the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed renewed for so long as such additional services are being provided.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Fee</h5>
        <p>
          Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, we have agreed upon the fee arrangement as more specifically set forth on the applicable Quote. Each Quote will set forth the Services, price, and any other information reasonably necessary for such engagement. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, if services are required outside the scope of those set forth in a Quote, our time will be billed at our then current hourly rates or Company-decided fixed price. All stated prices are exclusive of any taxes, fees and duties or other amounts, including, without limitation, value added and withholding taxes levied or based upon such charges, or upon this Agreement (other than taxes based on the net income of Company). Client shall pay any taxes related to Services purchased under this Agreement or Client shall present an exemption certificate acceptable to the taxing authorities. Applicable taxes shall be billed as a separate item on the invoice, to the extent possible. ALL FEES MADE TO COMPANY BY CLIENT PURSUANT TO THE SOW IS CONSIDERED FULLY EARNED BY COMPANY AT TIME OF PAYMENT AND IS NONREFUNDABLE FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Payment Invoices</h5>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise set forth on a Quote, Client agrees to pre-pay Company the price stated on any Quote, prior to the commencement of the applicable Services. Except as set forth herein or on the applicable invoice, each invoice is payable upon receipt. Past due payments shall bear interest at a rate of one percent (1.0%) per month and you shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred by us in collecting any past due payments. If any amount is not paid when requested or if any invoice is not paid within fifteen (15) days after the date of the invoice, then we reserve the right to discontinue providing services until all amounts past due are paid in full, and/or terminate immediately this Agreement and any Quote. A Quote may require you to deliver an initial retainer, which will be applied to the fees for Services. Upon exhaustion of the initial retainer, and each subsequent retainer, we may ask for an additional retainer in an amount approximately equal to any anticipated additional charges and expenses to be incurred.
        </p>

        <h5>5. Work for Hire</h5>
        <p>
          Upon payment in full to Company of all sums due under a Quote and this Agreement, all “creative elements” provided as part of the Services specified in the Quote will become the property of the Client and all of Company’s title and interest in such creative elements (other than Company’s Pre-Existing Work) will vest in the Client and be deemed a “work made for hire” for copyright purposes, provided, however, unless the Company has agreed in writing with Client to the contrary, that Company is herewith granted a non-exclusive license to utilize any such creative elements for in its business development efforts and marketing materials. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to transfer, convey or assign to Client any of Company’s rights in any software, information or other intellectual property which was previously owned by Company prior to the provision of the creative elements and/or services furnished hereunder and/or created independently and without reference to any materials or information of Client (“Pre-Existing Works”); provided, however, that if and to the extent any Pre-Existing Works are or have been provided to Client as part of the creative elements contemplated by this Agreement, in connection with the foregoing grant of the rights to the creative elements, upon payment of all applicable Quote Fees in full, Company grants to Client a royalty-free license in and to such Pre-Existing Works, to use and display same in conjunction with said creative elements.
        </p>

        <h5>6. Milestone Based Services</h5>
        <p>
          A Quote may be for Services provided on a milestone-completion basis. Company shall notify Client by email, text message, telephone call, and/or other electronic means of Company’s completion of a milestone or Service. Client has two (2) calendar days from Company notifying the completion of the milestone or Service (“Acceptance Period”) via email, text message, telephone call, and/or other electronic means to either accept or decline the completed milestone or Service. Client’s failure to notify Company during the Acceptance Period via email signifies Client’s acceptance of the completed milestone or Services. If Client declines the completed milestone or Service within the Acceptance Period, Client must provide details as to what and how the Services do not conform to the Quote.
        </p>
        <h5>7. Change Management Procedures</h5>
        <p>
          It may become necessary to amend a Quote for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: (i) changes to the statement of work and/or specifications for the Services, (ii) changes to the milestone invoice or payment schedule, (iii) changes to the project schedule due to unavailability of resources which are beyond either party’s control, and/or, (iv) technical conditions not previously identified. In the event either party desires to change a Quote, the following procedures shall apply:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The party requesting the change will deliver a “Change Request” to the other party by email. The Change Request will describe the nature of the change, the reason for the change, and the effect the change will have on the scope of work, the project schedule and costs.</li>
          <li>A Change Request may be initiated either by Client or by Company for any changes to the Quote. The parties will evaluate the Change Request and negotiate in good faith the changes to the Services and additional fees, if any, required to implement the Change Request. If both parties agree to implement the Change Request, both parties will sign the Change Request, indicating the acceptance of the changes by the parties.</li>
          <li>Upon acceptance of the Change Request and prepaying any additional Service fees associated therewith, said Change Request will be incorporated into, and made part of, the applicable Quote.</li>
          <li>Company is under no obligation to proceed with the Change Request until such time as the Change Request has been agreed upon in writing by both parties (which may be by email).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Whenever there is a conflict between the terms and conditions set forth in a fully executed Change Request and those set forth in the original Quote, or previous fully executed Change Request, the terms and conditions of the most recent fully executed Change Request shall prevail.
        </p>

        <h5>8. Termination</h5>
        <p>
          Either party has the right to terminate this Agreement or any Quote for any reason, including the ending of Services that are already underway, upon written notice to the other. In the event of Company’s termination of the Agreement or any SOW, Client shall pay Company for all Services performed under the affected SOWs up to the effective date of termination at the agreed upon prices, fees and expense reimbursement rates. In the event of Client’s termination of the Agreement or any SOW by Client, Company will retain all previously paid fees by Client corresponding to the affected SOW, and Client shall pay any remaining fee associated with the Services performed under the affected SOWs up to the effective date of termination at the agreed upon prices, fees and expense reimbursement rates within two (2) calendar days of the effective date of termination.
        </p>

        <h5>9. Revisions</h5>
        <p>

Client is required to request any revision no later than two (2) calendar days (time being of the essence) after delivery of same by us (and if any revision is requested after such time, we may require you to submit a Change Request for such revisions). Company is not responsible for failing to meet deadlines or timelines if revisions, feedback, / or approval are not provided to us within said 2-day period and/or in case of “Unlimited Revisions” provided in a Quote/Invoice from Company.

        <p>
          The parties acknowledge that Company’s employees, contractors, sub-contractors and staff members are valuable assets of Company (collectively, “Company Personnel”). Accordingly, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and one (1) year thereafter, Client agrees not to solicit, hire, offer to hire, subcontract, or otherwise do business with any Company Personnel (including direct or indirect employment, such as through a temporary staffing firm or on a freelance basis) or otherwise induce any Company Personnel to terminate, and/or otherwise alter the terms of, his or her relationship with Company.
